      "scenario": "A woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000, which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said, 'No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.' So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug for his wife.",

        "Heinz should not steal the medicine because it's against the law and he might get punished.",
        "Heinz should steal the medicine because his wife needs it and he tried to pay for it.",

        "Heinz should not steal because laws exist to maintain order, even in difficult situations.",
        "Heinz should steal because the right to life is more fundamental than property rights.",
